<p><strong>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use the personally identifiable information you provide on our website.Â  It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personally identifiable information and how you can access and update that information. If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please <a href="contact.php">contact us</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Other than as described in this Policy, we will not give any information about you to others without your express permission.</p>

<p><h3>Information Collection and Use</h3></p>

<p>Our website uses forms in which you give us personal contact and financial information (including your name, address, telephone number, and email address) so you can place orders, request information and support, and make payments.</p>

<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our website, or give us in any other way, including through email, telephone, or other communications with our team. If you contact us for support, we may keep an internal record of what support was given.</p>

<p>We use your information to contact you regarding functionality changes to our products and website, new  services and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please see the "Updating Your Information" section below on how to change your preferences.</p>
<p>We use information gathered about you from our website  statistics (for example, your IP address, location or device operating system) to help personalise your experience, diagnose problems, and to administer our website and services. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us improve our website  and make your browsing and purchasing experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information, except as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on our system.</p>

<p>Our website uses cookies to keep track of items added to your shopping cart. We use cookies to identify you so you don't need to log in each time you visit our website. The cookies are linked to your customer number, which is then associated with the information in your account.</p>

<p>Within our website  and applications we may use tracking technologies such as  CI codes (click tracking), ISC (source tracking), and ITC (item tracking codes, attached to purchases at an item level, used to determine where within the application a product was added).  We report this data back to our Afford A Host web services.  These results are not shared with any third parties and are used solely for  identifying characteristics of users so that we may optimise our applications and services.</p>
<p>This website may contain links to other websites. Unfortunately, Afford A Host is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.</p>

<p><h3>Security</h3></p>

<p>This website has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control.  When you enter personal sensitive information  on our order forms (such as contact or financial information), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security despite our best efforts.</p>


<p><h3>Sending Emails</h3></p>

<p>We use emails to communicate with you, to confirm your placed orders, and to send information that you have requested. We also provide email links to allow you to contact us directly. We strive to promptly reply to your messages.</p>

<p>The information you send to us may be stored and used to improve this website and our products, or it may be reviewed and discarded.</p>


<p><h3>Third Party Service Providers</h3></p>

<p>We may at times provide information about you to third parties to provide various services on our behalf, such as processing credit card payments, conducting contests or surveys, performing analyses of our products or customer demographics, shipping of goods or services, and customer relationship management. We will only share information about you that is necessary for the third party to provide the requested service. These companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

<p><h3>Google Analytics</h3></p>

<p>We use a tool called "Google Analytics" to collect information about use of this website, such as how often users visit the website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this website.  Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this website, rather than your name or other identifying information. </p>

<p>Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this website.  This cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google, Inc.  The information generated by the cookie will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.</p>

<p>We use the information received from Google Analytics only to improve services on this website.  We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.</p> 

<p>Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this website is restricted by the Google Privacy Policy.  You can prevent Google Analytics from recognising you on return visits to this website by disabling the Google Analytics cookie on your browser.</p>
<p><h3>Supplementation of Information</h3></p>

<p>In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personally identifiable information you submit to us with information from third party sources (e.g., information from our strategic partners and service providers).  We do this to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our products and services to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>

<p><h3>Contests/Surveys</h3></p>

<p>From time-to-time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If you choose to participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these contests or surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address) and demographic information. We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes and to enhance and promote our website and services.</p>

<p>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests. When we do, that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

<p><h3>Targeted Advertisements </h3></p>

<p>We may display targeted offers to our customers based on the products and services previously purchased by the customer.    There is no personal or geolocation information collected to build a profile about your activities or to be shared with third party advertising companies.</p>

<p>
<h3>Refer a Friend</h3>
</p>

<p>If a user elects to use our referral/affiliate service to inform a friend about our website, we may ask the user for the friend's name and email address. We will send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit our website. We may store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact us to request the removal of this information from our systems.</p>

<p>
<h3>What Happens to my Personally Identifiable Information if I Terminate my  Account or Service?</h3>
</p>

<p>When your Afford A Host account or service is cancelled (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your personally identifiable information is placed in "deactivated" status on our systems. However, deactivation of your account does not mean your personally identifiable information has been deleted from our databases entirely. We will retain and use your personally identifiable information as necessary in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.</p>

<p><h3>Updating Your Information </h3></p>

<p>You may alter, update or deactivate your account information or opt out of receiving communications from us  at any time. We have the following options for changing and modifying your account information or contact preferences.</p>

<p>You may send an email to us.<br />
You may update your account online.</p>


<p>We will respond to your request for access or to modify or deactivate your information within thirty (30) days. </p>

<p><h3>Transfer of Data Abroad</h3></p>

<p>If you are visiting this website from a country other than the country in which our servers are located, your communications with us may result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.  By visiting this website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to such transfers.</p>

<p><h3>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h3></p>

<p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN's rules, regulations and policies.</p>

<p>To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.</p>

<p><h3>Changes in Our Practices</h3></p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy and any other places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

<p>If we make any major changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page, at least thirty (30) days prior to the implementation of the changes.</p>
